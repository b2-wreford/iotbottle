        <p>This project allowed us to plan and create out very own IOT (Internet of Everything) device. We chose to create a sustainable device,<br></br> a product that is efficient and good for the environment and also good for the user. After brain storming a variety of potential products <br></br> that could be made we chose to create the IOT Water Bottle. To create this bottle we have had to tackle code to make a program that would track the <br></br> amount of water being drunk each day. We then also had to make the physical bottle and a Web Based UI to track the data taken from the bottle and allow the user to see their recorded data.<br></br> Here on this website you can see our fully functioning bottle.
